Sisyphus Drawer
=========================

Let's make it easy to make Sisyphus patterns.

### Implementation

Using Parcel for the bundler because it's super fast and requires little configuration.

### Cloning this code

I recommend making a new folder and cloning the git repo direclty into that. Otherwise the `git clone` command will create a folder called 'git'.

Install the dependencies and then run the Parcel dev server on `http://localhost:1234`.

When you want to build for production, use Parcel to bundle the project and then run the Node.js Express server which will serve static files from `/dist`.

```
~ npm run build
~ npm start
```
